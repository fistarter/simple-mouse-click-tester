# Simple mouse click tester
Simple mouse click tester originally intended as practise in order remove the built up code rust and for testing on my own mice.
1. Three modes for testing: Realtime, Highlight and Double Click mode.
2. Continuity test: Select RT mode, hold down the desired click and check if the mouse click counter increases.
3. Scroll test: Select HL mode, scroll in one direction and check if it highlights the scroll in the other direction.
4. Simultaneous click test: Select RT mode, press combinations of clicks (especially LMB+MB3 and MMB+MB4 if your mouse has MB3 and 4) and check if they both highlight at the same time.
5. Double click test: Select DC mode and perform single clicks to check if the mouse would perform a faulty doubleclick or check if you can perform double clicks with that mouse. Works for all buttons and the click counter only records the number of double clicks.
